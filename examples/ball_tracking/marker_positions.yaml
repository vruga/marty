# ArUco marker positions in world frame (robot base frame)
#
# YOUR SETUP:
#   - Camera: 10cm behind robot (-X), 30cm above base (+Z)
#   - Robot at origin (0, 0, 0)
#   - Looking at table in front
#
# World frame convention (adjust if yours differs):
#   Origin: Robot base center
#   X: forward (toward table/opponent)
#   Y: left (from robot's perspective)
#   Z: up
#
# IMPORTANT: Measure these positions with a tape measure!
# Accuracy here directly affects calibration quality.

markers:
  # Markers on table surface (z = table height)
  # Adjust x, y based on YOUR measurements from robot base

  0:  # Front-left corner of your workspace
    x: 0.30   # 30cm in front of robot
    y: 0.20   # 20cm to the left
    z: 0.76   # table height (standard 76cm, measure yours!)
    rx: 0     # flat on table, facing up
    ry: 0
    rz: 0

  1:  # Front-right corner
    x: 0.30
    y: -0.20  # 20cm to the right
    z: 0.76
    rx: 0
    ry: 0
    rz: 0

  2:  # Back-left (further from robot)
    x: 0.70   # 70cm in front
    y: 0.20
    z: 0.76
    rx: 0
    ry: 0
    rz: 0

  3:  # Back-right
    x: 0.70
    y: -0.20
    z: 0.76
    rx: 0
    ry: 0
    rz: 0

# ============================================================
# HOW TO MEASURE:
# ============================================================
# 1. Mark the robot base center on the table/floor
# 2. For each marker, measure:
#    - X: forward distance from robot base
#    - Y: left/right distance (+ = left, - = right)
#    - Z: height from ground (usually table height)
# 3. Place marker CENTER at the measured position
# 4. Update values above
#
# TIP: Use masking tape to mark exact positions, then place
# markers there during calibration. Remove after calibration.
